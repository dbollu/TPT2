# TPT2 REPOSITORY

By Florin_TK

## Description

This is a repository for files that are related to the game "The Perfect Tower 2". It contains scripts, import codes and blueprint codes.

## Notes for Fellow Players

### Spoilers

The documentation as well as the scripts and blueprints can **and will** contain **spoilers** about mid- or
late-game features! You'll get periodic reminders about that in the other `README.md` files, so unless you are
a very lategame player, I suggest that you mind your scrolling speed so you don't accidentally see what you
shouldn't.

### Requirements

Before even beginning to use this repo you'll want to have at least some progress into the game. That means
**at least Military Tier 4** for one of the major features of the game. Also make sure that you upgraded all
buildings you could upgrade to the highest tier you can afford.

## Roadmap

Here is the list of tasks currently followed by the author of this repository.

- pushing AI scripts
 - verifying that said scripts do not contain any errors
 - adding the base64 version of said approved scripts in order to facilitate in-game imports 
- adding some bp codes
- `README.md` in all directories, with all the needed documentation and ez import codes (mainly bp codes)
- etc.
